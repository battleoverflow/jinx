# Jinx: The Unlucky Framework
The Jinx Framework is a mini PHP framework created to provide simple components for building basic websites.

This framework was created to build custom CTF websites, local development and testing using PHP, vulnerable websites for testing, and more. Jinx is intentially minimal to allow for full freedom on the user's end. This means all controllers, models, layouts, and more will need to be created by the user. The example website, [powder](https://github.com/azazelm3dj3d/powder), showcases the "bare minimum", and how to utitlize all available components currently available in the Jinx Framework.

You can get started by installing via `composer`:

```bash
composer require azazelm3dj3d/jinx
```

Development is still in very early stages, but it should be stable enough to use in most simple use cases. It's not recommended to push the code in this framework to production yet until it's a little more mature.
